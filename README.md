# Ohana Rideshares

This used to be deployed and hosted with AWS (but I didn't want to pay to host it anymore!)

Ohana Rideshares is a Flask Python Project that allows for account registration and login to then request a ride from other users, choose to drive other riders, view ride details, and leave messages to the rider and/or the driver.

This is the first project I have ever attempted to deploy and is also the first time I have ever really tried to use a repository in GitHub.

## Installation

I *think* the **requirements.txt** file should have all of my installation methods, and it should be good to go. Otherwise you'll need to do the following.

```bash
# If the requirements.txt file does not work
pip install flask PyMySQL flask-bcrypt
#navigate to the ohana rideshare folder
pipenv install flask PyMySQL
pipenv shell
pipenv install flask-bcrypt
```
