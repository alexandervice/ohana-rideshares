# Ohana Rideshares

This used to be deployed and hosted with AWS (but I didn't want to pay to host it anymore!)

Ohana Rideshares is a Flask Python Project that allows for account registration and login to then request a ride from other users, choose to drive other riders, view ride details, and leave messages to the rider and/or the driver.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# If the requirements.txt file does not work

```bash
pip install flask PyMySQL flask-bcrypt
#navigate to the ohana rideshare folder
pipenv install flask PyMySQL
pipenv shell
pipenv install flask-bcrypt
```
